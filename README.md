# teams-deploy-notifier [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/teams-deploy-notifier.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/teams-deploy-notifier)
> CLI tool to notify your colleagues on MS Teams that you've deployed something

## Installation

```
npm install -g teams-deploy-notifier
```

## Usage

1. Create a `.teams-notifier.config.json` file in the root directory of your project. It should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "projectName": "REQUIRED: the name of your project",
  "teamsUrl": "REQUIRED: your ms teams webhook url",
  "options": {
    "themeColor": "OPTIONAL: hex code for your color without the #"
  }
}
```

2. When you are ready to deploy call the cli and pass in the service and path options:

`--service`: the name of the service that you want to deploy with. Examples include [now](https://zeit.co/now) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

`--path`: the path to the directory that you want to deploy. For example if you want to deploy the build directory you might pass in `build` if you wanted to deploy the current directory you might pass in `.`

```bash
teams-deploy-notifier --service now --path build
```

3. Thats it! On successful deploy and notification you will see the info from your service provider printed to the console as well as a green message saying `Deployment message posted to Teams`
